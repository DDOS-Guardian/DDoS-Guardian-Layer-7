# DDOS Guardian Layer 7 Version

## What is this?
DDoS Guardian Layer 7 Provides protection toward layer 7 website DDoS attacks.
The way it works is by adding a firewall that goes through DDoS Guardian that sends to the server, Which than checks if the request is friendly.

## Level 7 Setup

### Dependency
You will need DDoS Guardian to use this. Please [Install DDoS Guardian](https://github.com/xlelord9292/ddos-guardian "Install DDoS Guardian")

### Installing
You then go to the directory ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/ddos-guardian-layer-7`` and download **protection.lua** into it. Run this below to download it:
```sh
curl -Lo protection.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DDOS-Guardian/DDoS-Guardian-Layer-7/main/protection.lua```

### Editing
After downloading everything, You need to edit a few things! First, there is a variable named "whitelist", You need to add your Server IP (Ex. 184.156.178.1). If you have a IPV4 and IPV6, Do this to allow your server to send all sorts of requests and ignore the firewalls between your server.
```lua
local whitelist = {
    "IP1",
	"IP2"
}```

Next, Please find this in the code, and change the "SITE-KEY_ to your Cloudflare Key.
```lua
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="SITE-KEY" data-callback="onSubmit"></div> ```

## How to get the cloudflare key?
- 1. Go To Cloudflare
